# dsh-dream

> **An agent that dreams**: session replay (dream material) → reflection (interpretation) → dream journal (memory consolidation).

Humans consolidate memories by replaying the day during sleep — dsh-dream gives DeepSeek Harness agents the same ability. It reads your historical sessions (the official multi-frame zstd session logs, parsed with zero dependencies), distills dream material, lets the agent reflect, and writes permanent dream journal entries that can be recalled later.

## Compatibility

Verified with official `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.5-rc.1` and Node `24.16.0` on 2026-09-11: all 18 components load alongside Modlens, with passing tool-schema, skill-registration and offline read-only invocation checks. Uses the `cordis.patch.yml` + `dsh.bundle.patch` bundle model. Node requirements match this Harness release: 22.19 or later within 22.x, or 24 or later. Live external-service workflows require separate configuration and validation.

Reads v0/v1/v2/v3 plaintext JSONL and multi-frame zstd, legacy packed chunks and v2/v3 embedded streams. Only the newest canonical file is selected per session. PTC child calls retain tool names without double counting; system prompts, reasoning, tool arguments and result bodies are excluded.

Default data directories follow `DSH_HOME`: `sessions` for session logs and `.dsh-dream` for the journal. Without `DSH_HOME`, the base is `~/.dsh`. Explicit `sessionsRoot` and `journalDir` settings take precedence.

## Install / Uninstall

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @stardustlc/dsh-dream
# or from source:
dsh plugin --profile web add github:STARDUSTLC666/dsh-dream
dsh plugin --profile web remove @stardustlc/dsh-dream
```

Restart the web service afterwards. The dream journal lives at `~/.dsh/.dsh-dream/dreams.jsonl` and survives uninstallation; remove that directory manually for a full cleanup. Part of [dsh-suite](https://github.com/STARDUSTLC666/dsh-suite) — one command installs all 18 STARDUSTLC plugins.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Key params |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `dream_digest` | Replay recent sessions (title/turns/user quotes/assistant conclusions/tool footprint); subagent sessions skipped; official packed-chunk rows decoded | `maxSessions`; `mode`: full/brief |
| `dream_save` | Write a reflection + 1-5 lessons + mood to the permanent journal | `reflection` required |
| `dream_journal` | List dreams, newest first | `limit` |
| `dream_recall` | Keyword search across the journal | `query` required |
| `dream_bridge` | Merge top lessons into AGENTS.md (idempotent marker block) — dreams become long-term memory | `path` required |
| `dream_health` | Self-check: sessions dir / dream count / config summary | — |

`dream_bridge` merges the most frequent dream lessons into a target `AGENTS.md` behind idempotent marker blocks; `dream_journal` also reports mood distribution and top lessons.

The bundled `dream-protocol` skill teaches the agent when and how to dream (and the journaling discipline: patterns only, never secrets).

## Privacy (on by default)

Dream material is masked before journaling: sk keys, GitHub/Groq/Slack tokens, AWS keys, JWTs, `password/token/api_key` assignments and long high-entropy strings become `[masked·type]`. Disable with `maskSecrets: false`.

## Permissions & data

Read-only access to the sessions directory; appends JSONL to the journal directory; no network calls. Session content may be sensitive — the protocol forbids secrets in dreams, but the journal is plaintext: review before sharing.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test   # build + offline tests (session generations, zstd, streams, masking, journal, bridge, registration)
```
